GitHub allows you to collaborate on and keep track of source code in a fairly efficient way.\n","\n","*  *commit*: A commit can be thought of as a change that is applied to some set of files. i.e., if some set of files is in some state A, you can make changes to A and *commit* your changes to the set of files so that it is now in state B.  A commit is identified by a *hash* of the information in your change (the author of the commit, who actually committed [i.e. applied] the changes to the set of files, the changes themselves, etc.)\n","\n","* *parent commit*: The commit that came before your current commit.\n","\n","*   *repo*:  A repo (short for repository) is GitHub's abstraction for a collection of files along with a history of commits on those files. If you have GitHub username \"foo\" and you make a repository called \"data-rocks\", your repo name will be \"foo/data-rocks\".  You can think of a repo's history in terms of its commits.  E.g., \"foo/data-rocks\" can have the set of \"states\" A->B->C->D, where each state change (A->B, B->C, C->D) was due to a commit.\n","\n","*   *branch*:  To keep track of different commit histories, GitHub repos can have branches.  The 'main' branch (i.e. commit history) of the repo is called the 'master' branch.  Say on \"foo/data-rocks\" we have the commit history A->B->C->D on the master branch.  If someone else comes along and decides to add a cool new feature to \"foo/data-rocks\", they can create a branch called \"cool-new-feature\" that branches away from the master branch. All the code from the main branch will be there, but new code added to \"cool-new-feature\" will not be on the main branch.\n","\n","*   *ref*: For the purpose of this assignment, you can think of the 'ref' field on the \"files\" table as referring to the branch in which a file lives in a repository at some point in time.\n","\n","\n","\n","For the purposes of this question, you don't need to know about the following things in detail:\n","\n","\n","*   Commit trees\n","*   The encoding attribute on the commits table\n","\n","If you want more clarifications about Git and GitHub in order to answer this question, be sure to post on Ed or come to Office Hours.
