        <h2>Course Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This course covers how to use databases in applications, first principles on how to scale for large data sets and how to design good data systems.</p>
        <p>A few key topics:</p>
        <p>&mdash; Introduction to relational data model, relational database engines, and SQL.</p>
        <p>&mdash; How to scale systems for large data sets on servers and server clusters</p>
        <p>&mdash; How to design good schemas based on dependencies, normal forms so we build and evolve good applications. This will include indexes, views and transactions.</p>
        <p>The class will culminate in a hands-on programming project in SQL+Python &mdash; a key part of the course &mdash; where you will query, visualize and predict from terabytes of data on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a>, a popular cloud database part of Google Cloud Platform.</p>

        <hr>
        <p><b>Prerequisites</b> CS 103 and CS 107 (or equivalent)</p>

        <p><b>Grading</b> Projects: 50% (10 + 15 + 25), Exam #1: 15%, Exam #2: 25%, Homework: 10%.</p>
        <p>We will be offering extra credit for in class participation and high quality answers to fellow student questions in piazza.</p>

        <p>
          <b>Ed</b> We will be creating our Ed soon.
          <!-- Join our <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/14868">Ed</a> to receive important
          announcements and get answers to your questions. -->
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Homeworks</b> There will be 4 biweekly homework assignments, worth 10% of your final grade, that accompany the material being taught in class. 
          They will be graded on completion basis — meaning that you 
          will receive full credit as long as you submit the assignment on time and receive a grade above 70%. You will submit your homeork through Gradescope.
          <b>No late days can be used on homework.</b>
          <br>
          The homework assignments reflect the exam material, so it is in your best interest to complete them thoroughly. Aside from preparing you 
          for the exam, they will assess and reinforce your understanding of the material.

          <!-- You can access the homeworks through <a href="http://www.newgradiance.com/services">Gradiance</a>
          by creating an account (if you don't already have one) then signing
          up for class token <b>E68759F1</b>. Once you have joined the class, navigate
          to the Homeworks section on the left. <b>NOTE:</b> when we write "lab"
          we indicate that you should do the corresponding lab found in the "Lab Projects" tab,
          instead of the Homework tab. -->
        </p>
        <p><b>Sections</b> There will be 4 optional discussion sections that will accompany each homework assignment. 
          The sections will be recorded and uploaded to Canvas. The slides will be posted online.

        </p>

        <b>Exam Dates</b>
        <ul>

        <p>
          <b>Late Days</b> You are allowed a total of <b>two</b> late days
          shared between all project deadlines. You do not lose any credit when
          using a late day. If you run out of late days and submit after the
          deadline, you receive a 0. (Late days can only be applied for projects.)
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Lectures</b> Lectures occur on Tues/Thurs 4:30-5:50 p.m. in NVIDIA Auditorium. 
          NOTE that while attendance is not mandatory, we will be giving out extra credit for students with insightful in-class participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Lecture Videos</b> Lecture videos will be recorded and posted on <a href="https://canvas.stanford.edu/">Canvas</a>.
        </p>

        <b>Textbook</b> There is no required textbook, but for students who want additional resources, we recommend the following two:
        <ul>
          <li>Database Systems 2nd Edition by Garcia-Molina</li>
          <li>First Course in Database Systems 3rd Edition by Ullman</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Accomodations</b> If you need an academic accommodation based on a disability, you should initiate the request with the 
          Office of Accessible Education (OAE). The OAE will evaluate the request, recommend accommodations, and prepare a letter for 
          faculty. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible and at any rate in advance of assignment deadlines, since timely 
          notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. If you need OAE accommodations for exams, please notify us at least 7 days 
          (ONE week) prior to the exams.

        <h2>Honor Code/Collaboration Policy</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Students must adhere to <a href="https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/honor-code">The Stanford Honor Code</a> 
          and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164/handouts/honor-code.pdf">The Stanford Honor Code</a> as it  pertains to CS courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage students to form study groups. Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups. 
          However, each student must write down the solution independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It is an honor code violation to copy, refer to, or look at written or code solutions from a previous year, 
          including but not limited to: official solutions from a previous year, solutions posted online, and solutions 
          you or someone else may have written up in a previous year. Furthermore, it is an honor code violation to post 
          your assignment solutions online, such as on a public git repo.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The teaching staff will be using plagiarism detection software and if we have reason to believe that you are in 
        violation of the honor code, we will follow the university policy to report it.

        <p>
          <b>Group Size</b> The first two projects are individual only, but the third project you are allowed
          to work in teams of two.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Project Submissions</b>
          You will submit your projects via Gradescope. You should have been automatically signed up for gradescope.

          Each assignment will include specific instructions regarding what
          files to submit.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Regrade Policy</b>
          If you think that we've made a grading mistake or that the work
          you submitted should be regraded, submit a regrade request on
          Gradescope within one week of receiving your grade. Be sure that you
          prepare a short and convincing argument on Gradescope about why you
          think your work was incorrectly graded – we reserve the right to
          ignore your regrade request if you don't provide a justification.

          If you submit a regrade request, we reserve the right to regrade your
          entire assignment. This means that your overall score could go
          down.
